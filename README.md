# Arduino-learning

**Learning path provided by user id - u/More-Requirement-576/**

Okay so for the beginners and for the intermediates we can start core electronics from various sources I have mentioned below. Do note that all the resources I am mentioning below are from where I learned all the tuff since I was in class 7th....

So for the very beginning we can start with Arduino and basic electronics for that please get a basic Arduino Kit which must include :

1. Arduino (Leonardo or UNO) + Data Coble
2. Breadboard
3. Jumper Wires (male to female, M2M, F2F)
4. LED (2-3 colors)
5. Resistor Set (Box)
6. Knob Potentiometer
7. IR Sensor
8. Ultrasonic Sensor
9. 7 Segment Display
10. DHT 11 or 22 Temperature Sensor
11. PIR Sensor
12. RFID Tag and Module
13. Push Button
14. 22 AWG Standard Wire (1 meter)
15. NodeMCU (8266 module) + Cable
16. L293D Motor Driver Module
17. 9G Servo Motor
18. Bo-Gear Motor + Tyre
19. A Good MULTIMETER

for the beginners, above modules and components should work! Once you learn about the above onces then I need not tell you what else to buy so start with this! To buy the above, dont go to Amazon or Flipkart, Robu.in is the best website for the same and you can trust, RoboCraze, ElectronicsComp are other good websites for such devices (amazon,flipkart are not good for these)

Also, in the above list, I tried my best to include every type of sensor (Digital, Analog, I2C, UART, SPI, etc) but still if any type left, that you can learn using other sensors on the later stage, first for the beginners these technologies are more than enough to start.

Now from where to learn?:

I am suggesting YouTube Channels as those are go to material but a big disclaimer, please dont watch videos just like movies, get your hands dirty please and dont go to Online Softwares like TinkerCAD or other simulators, until you wont get your hands dirty with actual material, you wont learn the stuff!

Here are the best YouTube Channels and Playlists:

1. Engineers and Electronics: a) First Start with this Series (Basic): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzJayPUPV6A&list=PLV3C-t_tgjGFyXP_-AF37AoIuxM9jzELM

b) Then Follow this to work with different sensors and Components: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v_DF-zhrPw&list=PLV3C-t_tgjGE1USbPg2jrrDMu26F_M7K-

c) After mastering above Concepts + Practical Experimentation, refer this series for IoT and Cool Stuff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj2h3FaxEQY&list=PLV3C-t_tgjGGtrc6xXHG439UrYD1DrnIH

2) DroneBot Workshop (The best for details+ Academic): https://www.youtube.com/@Dronebotworkshop/videos

3) ElectroNoobs: Best for Cool Projects and Ideas

4) GreatScott(For Detailed and Practical Electronics): Best for Basic Electronics Series (Must Watch before Starting Arduino): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAROrg3NQn7cyu01HpOv5BWo217XWBZu0 (Watch some important videos before Starting Arduino)

5) Ben Eater (God for Advanced Stuff(refer this channel once you learn the above stuff)

Please do refer the Official Documentation for more detailed understanding and Concepts! Its a really good Practice!

and many more are there but to reduce the confusion and to reduce the Tutorial Hell, I am suggesting the above resources only as these ones are more detailed and best in terms of explanation!

If you have mastered the above Concepts + Practical implementation then Congratulations, Get Raspberry Pi and Die!
